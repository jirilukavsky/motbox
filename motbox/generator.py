    """Generates straight trajectory at random starting points.
    returns the trajectory as a csv, and then saves a plot and video if wanted

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        number of objects to be moved
    speed : float or tuple of floats
        how far will the object move each "tick". Dependent on the length of the time parameter. If touple, it needs to have the same length as
        is the number of positions. Allows separate speeds to be applied to each object. e.g. (speed for first object, speed for second, etc.)
    time : float
        time of the
    frequency : int
        frequency at which to
    xlim : tuple of floats (-10, 10)
        limits of the box in which the objects move
    ylim : tuple of floats (-10, 10)
        limits of the box in which the objects move
    spacing : float (1)
        defines spacing between objects to allow poucing from walls and from objects. Usually diameter of the object.
    save : bool (True)
        should the trajectory be saved as a csv? path and filename should be provided to override the default
    filename : str ('track')
        name of the file to be prepended to csv, plot and video files
    plot : bool (False)
        if the plot of the trajectory should be created. filename is used to determine name of the plot
    video : bool (False)
        if the video of the trajectory should be created. filename is used to create name of the video

    Return
    --------
    Saves .csv file at location
